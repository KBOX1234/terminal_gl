# terminal GL
Terminal GL is a graphics library that will run on anything from your fancy rgb gaming setup, to your grandmother's potato from 1985 (no joke (kinda, does not run on real potato)).
<br>
To use, you need to include terminal_gl.h and then a backend found in ./impl after that.
<br>
To create a backend, create the functions found in impl/impl.h. Terminal GL uses the functions in impl.h to run.
